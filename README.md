# Excel-REVENUE DASHBOARD
The goal of this project was to determine the top revenue products, the sales team that made the most revenue and the relationship between revenue, population and the median income of the .

I started by cleaning the data to make sure there were no outliers or duplicates.
I derived the revenue by simple multiplication of order quantity and unit price, order cost by multiplication of the order quantity and unit cost and profit by subtraction of order cost from revenue for each of the products purchased.

I modelled the data also called data modelling and created relationships using the primary and foreign keys across each table in the different sheets. I created pivot tables and charts to determine the top products; sales teams and states by revenue. I used the line chart to determine the revenue trend between January to May. I also added the product category slicer and timeline to make the dashboard report sliceable.
